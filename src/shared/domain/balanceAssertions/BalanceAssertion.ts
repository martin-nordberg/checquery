/**
 * Base schema for a Checquery balance assertion's details. A balance assertion claims that, as of a given
 * date, the sum of every entry posted to the account whose transaction has cleared by that date equals a
 * stated balance -- pinning the ledger to an external source of truth (typically a bank statement). It
 * doesn't reference or create any transactions itself; it's checked by comparing that sum against the
 * asserted balance (mismatches are flagged to the user via UI still to be designed). Uniqueness of the
 * (acctId, assertionDate) pair is an application-level concern -- it needs the full set of assertions for
 * an account and isn't checkable from a single assertion, so it isn't enforced here.
