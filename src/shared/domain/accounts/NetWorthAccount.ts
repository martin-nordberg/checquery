 * category. Unlike the virtual root categories (never inserted as real rows), Net Worth must be a genuine,
 * insertable Account row: it's a real post-able account (e.g. an opening-balance entry might debit/credit
 * it directly), not just a structural placeholder. It is seeded once, when a new file is created -- see
 * bootstrapNetWorthAccount in src/bun/persistence/db.ts.
