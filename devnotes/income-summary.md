# Income Summary Account
An income summary account is a temporary, year-end holding account used during the closing process to aggregate all revenues and expenses, determining net income or loss before transferring it to retained earnings. It resets temporary accounts to zero, ensuring a fresh start for the new fiscal year.
## How the Income Summary Account Works:
* Temporary Nature: It only exists during the closing process, having a zero balance for the rest of the year.
* Closing Revenues: At the end of the period, revenue accounts are debited, and the Income Summary account is credited, moving the total revenue to the summary.
* Closing Expenses: Expense accounts are credited, and the Income Summary account is debited, moving the total expenses to the summary.
* Determining Profit/Loss: If the total credits (revenues) exceed debits (expenses), the account has a credit balance representing net income. Conversely, higher expenses produce a debit balance (net loss).
* Transfer to Equity: The final balance in the Income Summary is transferred (closed) to the owner's capital or retained earnings account, bringing the Income Summary account balance back to zero.
## Key Functions:
* Organizes Records: Acts as a central location to summarize all income statement accounts.
* Facilitates Closing: Simplifies the process of moving temporary account balances to the balance sheet.
* Audit Trail: Provides a clear, detailed record of the company's financial performance for the year.
